# BarcodeRevComp
Simple python script to reverse complement MBCs or any index sequence in a csv file. Outputs csv.


I got tired of manually revcomping Index sequences for NextSeq and NovaSeq when trying to build a sample sheet. This script will take an input csv file with 2 fields: the barcode name/id, and the original sequence.
